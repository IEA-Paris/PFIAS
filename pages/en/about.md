The [**Proceedings of the French Institutes for Advanced Studies**](https://France.PIAS.science "PFIAS") (PFIAS) is a platform to promote and showcase the outstanding work produced by the Institutes for Advanced Studies fellows in France. Each of these institutes is a research centre that welcomes researchers from all over the world in various fields. It was created by the [**French Network of Institutes for Advanced Studies**](http://rfiea "RFIEA") (RFIEA).

Beyond their international aspect, the research projects carried out at the Institutes are characterized by an interdisciplinary approach (bringing together science, politics, economy, and society) and the development of new methodologies and perspectives. It encourages collaboration between research, administration, the economic world and citizens to meet the challenges of our time and those to come.

Each year, the Institute's research fellows and partner institutions organize many scientific events on its premises, on fundamental research or in response to major societal problems.

These proceedings present the conferences, lecture series and other scientific productions of the French Institutes for Advanced Studies in the form of indexed and quotable publications, often accompanied by videos or podcasts.
